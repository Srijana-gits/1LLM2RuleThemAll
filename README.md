# 1llm2ruletheworld

This is my learning project where I’m experimenting with building an LLM from scratch and playing around with text generation.

# Dataset

I trained on The Lord of the Rings trilogy, split into 6 books (~60 chapters):

The Fellowship of the Ring (Books I & II)

The Two Towers (Books III & IV)

The Return of the King (Books V & VI)

# Goals

Learn the fundamentals of LLMs (tokenization, embeddings, transformers)

Train small models for fun experiments

Generate outputs inspired by Tolkien’s world

Build intuition, not a state-of-the-art model
